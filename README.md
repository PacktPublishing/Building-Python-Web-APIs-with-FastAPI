**A fast-paced guide to building high-performance, robust web APIs with very little boilerplate code**

## What is this book about?
RESTful web services are commonly used to create APIs for web-based applications owing to their light weight and high scalability. This book will show you how FastAPI, a high-performance web framework for building RESTful APIs in Python, allows you to build robust web APIs that are simple and intuitive and makes it easy to build quickly with very little boilerplate code.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Set up a FastAPI application that is fully functional and secure
* Understand how to handle errors from requests and send proper responses in FastAPI
* Integrate and connect your application to a SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB) database
* Perform CRUD operations using SQL and FastAPI
* Manage concurrency in FastAPI applications

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter05.

The code will look like the following:
```
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List
class Event(BaseModel):
   id: int
   title: str
   image: str
   description: str
   tags: List[str]
   location: str  
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is for Python developers who want to learn FastAPI in a pragmatic way to create robust web APIs with ease. If you are a Django or Flask developer looking to try something new that's faster, more efficient, and produces fewer bugs, this FastAPI Python book is for you. The book assumes intermediate-level knowledge of Python programming.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-09).
